# README generator by Hannah Schmidt
  
  ## Description
  Crafting a comprehensive README file for each project can be time-consuming, especially when juggling multiple projects. I created this README generator to streamline the process and ensure that every project has a well-structured, informative README without having to start from scratch each time.
  The goal of this project was to simplify and accelerate the README creation process. By automating the generation of key sections like project description, installation instructions, usage guidelines, and license information, developers can focus more on coding and less on documentation.
  Many developers struggle with creating consistent and complete README files, which are crucial for both project documentation and collaboration. This generator addresses the issue by providing a user-friendly command-line interface to input essential details and automatically produce a formatted README.md file. This ensures that every project has a standardized and professional documentation format, improving clarity and ease of use for other developers or users.
